                        <p>My background is in animal behavior and predator-prey ecology. I received a BS in Biology from Boise State in 2015. During that time, I researched bat-moth interactions, took part in two international research trips, and published a paper. I joined a PhD program at Purdue University, but left in 2017 after realizing I didn't want to be in modern academia.</p>

                        <p>I am currently a Computer Science student at Boise State, and will graduate with my BS in late 2019. During this time, I have been relentless in learning new languages and technology, taking online courses while simultaneously attending school. I am searching for my first internship opportunity, and would love to contribute to your team.</p>

                    <h3>Web Dev</h3>
                    <p>I just started Web Dev, but find it really enjoyable. I know Javascript (ES5 and ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3, as well as tools like npm, Webpack, and Babel. I am currently learning React. I prefer the logic side of Web Development over the design side.</p>

                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                    <p>My academic past gives me both a background in and passion for data science. I have some experince in R, and am currently learning Python with the goal of exploring machine learning.</p>

                    <h3>App Dev</h3>
                    <p>I am interested in applications that make lives easier. I am most experienced with Java, although I have plans to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I am working on making a scheduling application for a specific workforce.</p>

                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>My first programming experience was with C# and Unity. I made several simple games (although not all were archived!) before starting my formal CS education. I am particularly interested in educational gamification.</p>
