                    <p>I know Javascript (ES5 and ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3, all at an intermediate level. I am currently learning React. I prefer the logic side of Web Development over the design side.</p>

                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                    <p>My academic background gives me both a background in and passion for data science. I have some experince in R, and am currently learning Python with the goal of exploring machine learning.</p>

                    <p>I am interested in applications that make lives easier. I am most experienced with Java, although I have plans to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I am working on making a scheduling application for a specific workforce.</p>

                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>My first programming experience was with C# and Unity. I made several simple games (although not all were archived!) before starting my formal CS education. I am particularly interested in educational gamification.</p>
